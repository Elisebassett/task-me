# README

TODO: Make your Readme real nice: include information on how to deploy your app,
how to run it locally, how to run tests.

Configure the CI using one of the CI services: TravisCI, or CircleCI, or SemaphoreCI,
then you can put a "green" (tests-are-passing) badge on your readme.

A good-looking Readme file make the application look more complete,
serious, production-worthy.

An example of great Readme: https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck (no joke - seriously)

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
